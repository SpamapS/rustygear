Rustygeard is a Rust-Native implementation of a [Gearman](https://gearman.org/) server.

Features
- Admin protocol (Partial)
- Coalescing of unique foreground jobs
- Round-robin dequeue on multi-function workers (--round-robin on C/C++ gearmand)

Rustygeard is still very much Alpha quality software lacking detailed
documentation and many of the features of the more mature C/C++ gearmand.
