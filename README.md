This started life as a port of the python gear library to Rust.

But since has been rewritten from scratch to be a server first.

# rustygear

The client library is under heavy churn, caveat emptor! Please read the
examples and docs and report a bug if you find one. Thanks!

# rustygeard

This is not production tested in any way, so do be careful. However, it's been
tested as a good drop-in replacement for the C/C++ daemon, although the admin
protocol is lacking. Anyway, try it out, report an issue, I'd love to hear from
you.
